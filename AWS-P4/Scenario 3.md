# Cloud-Native Solution for Legacy On-Premises Infrastructure

## Overview
This document outlines a cloud-native solution to modernize legacy on-premises applications by migrating them to AWS while retaining the database on-premises. The solution addresses challenges such as single points of failure, scalability limitations, security vulnerabilities, and inefficient resource allocation.

## Solution Components
### 1. **Hybrid Network Connectivity**
- **AWS VPN Gateway**: Establishes a secure IPSec VPN tunnel between the on-premises network and AWS VPC.
- **Customer Gateway**: Configured on-premises to connect to the AWS VPN Gateway.
- **VPC Design**:
  - Public subnets for internet-facing resources (e.g., Load Balancer).
  - Private subnets for application servers to ensure security.
  - NAT Gateway for outbound internet access in private subnets.

### 2. **Application Hosting**
- **EC2 Auto Scaling Group**: Deploys application servers across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Distributes traffic to EC2 instances and handles SSL termination.
- **Containerization (Optional)**: Use Amazon ECS/Fargate for containerized workloads.

### 3. **Security Measures**
- **Data in Transit**: TLS/SSL encryption via ALB and VPN.
- **Data at Rest**: Encrypt EBS volumes using AWS KMS.
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access for EC2 instances.
- **Security Groups & NACLs**: Restrict traffic to required ports (e.g., HTTPS, VPN).

### 4. **On-Premises Database**
- **High Availability (HA)**: Implement database clustering (e.g., MySQL Master-Slave, PostgreSQL Streaming Replication).
- **Backups**: Regular backups with encryption and off-site storage.
- **Monitoring**: Use on-prem tools (e.g., Prometheus) or integrate with Amazon CloudWatch.

### 5. **Performance & Redundancy**
- **AWS Global Accelerator**: Improve connectivity speed to on-premises databases.
- **Caching**: Deploy Amazon ElastiCache (Redis/Memcached) to reduce database load.
- **Multi-AZ Deployments**: Ensure all AWS resources span at least two AZs.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Configure Hybrid Networking
1. **Create a VPC** with public and private subnets in two AZs.
2. **Deploy a VPN Gateway** in the VPC and configure a Customer Gateway on-premises.
3. **Set up a Site-to-Site VPN** with BGP routing for dynamic failover.

### Step 2: Deploy Scalable Application
1. **Launch EC2 Instances** in private subnets with a Linux/Windows AMI.
2. **Create an Auto Scaling Group** with minimum 2 instances across AZs.
3. **Attach an Application Load Balancer** to the Auto Scaling Group.
4. **Configure HTTPS** using AWS Certificate Manager (ACM).

### Step 3: Secure the Environment
1. **Encrypt EBS Volumes**: Enable encryption during EC2 instance creation.
2. **Apply Security Groups**:
   - ALB: Allow HTTPS (443) from the internet.
   - EC2: Allow HTTP (80) only from the ALB and VPN CIDR.
3. **Store Database Credentials** in AWS Secrets Manager.

### Step 4: On-Premises Database Setup
1. **Implement Database Replication** (e.g., MySQL Master-Slave).
2. **Configure Firewall Rules** to allow traffic only from the VPN CIDR.
3. **Enable TDE (Transparent Data Encryption)** for data at rest.

### Step 5: Monitoring & Optimization
1. **Enable CloudWatch Alerts** for EC2 CPU, network usage, and VPN status.
2. **Deploy ElastiCache** to cache frequent database queries.
3. **Test Failover** for database and application layers.

## Considerations
### Domain Configuration
- Use Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to the ALB.
- Configure DNS failover for disaster recovery.

### CDN Integration
- **Amazon CloudFront**: Cache static assets (e.g., images, CSS/JS) at edge locations.
- **Origin Shield**: Reduce load on the origin (ALB or S3).

### Cost Optimization
- Use Spot Instances for non-critical workloads.
- Monitor VPN data transfer costs.

## Conclusion
This solution achieves scalability, security, and high availability while maintaining a hybrid architecture. Future steps could include migrating the database to Amazon RDS for full cloud-native benefits.
